# AdventOfCode 2023

My source repository for this year's awesome [AdventOfCode](https://adventofcode.com).

Since AdventOfCode is a great opportunity to get to know new languages and/or paradigms,
this year I will try to get my feet wet with some [Rust](rust-lang.org), "A language empowering everyone
to build reliable and efficient software".

**Please note that I started to learn some rust a week before AdventOfCode.**  
Comments on the code are welcome, I would really like to see some discussion in GitHub issues :).
